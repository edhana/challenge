How to run
===

- I included a dockerfile because I don't like to keep my development machine clean
- this project uses ruby 2.4.0
- if running locally use the bundle tool to install gems from Gemfile. run `bundle`
- execute tests with `rspec spec/hparser_spec`
- run application with `ruby main.rb`
