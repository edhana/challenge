How to run
===

- I included a dockerfile because I like to keep my development machine clean
- this project uses ruby 2.4.0
- if running locally use the bundle tool to install gems from Gemfile. run `bundle`
- execute tests with `rspec spec/hparser_spec.rb`
- run application with `ruby main.rb` or just `./main.rb` if you have
  your ruby executable in the default system path


What is being saved
===

On your local folder an yml file is saved with the word count requested by the challenge spec. The file name is words.yml.
